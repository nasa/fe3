#+TITLE: Fe3 API and Data Models

#+OPTIONS: creator:nil

* Introduction
  This document describes the API specification and implementation *release schedule* for Fe3 simulator.  It will be updated frequently.  The specification  and associated data models are described using OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.0 (=https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification=) and can be found in the GIT repository located at
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  https://github.com/nasa/fe3
  #+END_SRC
  The Fe3 simulation engine is high-fidelity simulator that incorporates 6DOF vehicle dynamics, navigation, control, communication, and spatially and temporally varying three dimensional wind fields. 
It is capable of simulating 1000s of multi-vehicle operations in seconds by leveraging an auto-scaling cluster of P3 GPU instances on AWS. 

  #+CAPTION: The simulation models that are used in Fe3 are 6DOF models that incorporate Eulerian and aerodynamic moments and forces.  In addition, in some vehicles, battery and motor dynamics are also modeled.  This figure depicts where the models lie along the fidelity spectrum and how the use of an auto-scaling GPU cluster can push the curve to the upper right reducing simulation time.

* API and Data Model Specification Release Schedule
  The GIT repository for the Fe3 API and data models is used by nasa and external partners.
  The master branch will be tagged with a version identifier of the form vx.y.z.  Twenty four hours prior to a change, we will announce that a change is forthcoming.  We will identify the new tag and the release branch that contains the intended changes.  During this time, developers can inspect the release branch and assess the impact to their code/build cycles.  If it is determined that the change will have an adverse impact, developers can point their code to the current (stable) GIT tag idenfitier.  Our GIT branching model for both specification and code generally follows the one outlined here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow


  | Date Announced   | Review-Branch  | Date Implemented | Tag on Master | Desc            |
  |------------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+-----------------|
  | <2020-06-15 Mon> | release-v1.0.1 | <2020-06-29 Mon> | v1.0.1        | Initial Release |

* API Release Schedule
  This schedule is intended to convey to Fe3 participants when NASA servers will support the various end-points described in the OpenAPI specification.  It is to be assumed that the endpoints, when released, will support the latest tag on the master branch.    
  | Endpoint | Location | Sprint           | Release Date     |

* Fe3 Modeling and Simulation
** Introduction
We are at the cusp of an aviation revolution whereby flying cyber-physical systems will disrupt and transform entire industries.  The convergence of new technologies including electric propulsion and autonomy together with new business models is generating the potential for a new aviation market known as Urban Air Mobility (UAM). 
This transformation aims to radically redefine how and where value is created and disseminated. 

UAM is a safe and efficient system for air passenger and cargo transportation within an urban area, inclusive of small package delivery and other urban Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) services, that supports a mix of onboard/ground-piloted and increasingly autonomous operations.
UAM is poised to spawn a new vertical mobility ecosystem driven by emerging markets centered around intra and inter-city passenger transportation, inspection, and package delivery. 
Building on previous work in UAS Traffic Management (UTM at https://utm.arc.nasa.gov/index.shtml) in partnership with the FAA, NASA aims to develop a research platform to investigate all aspects critical to enable safe and efficient operations.  The core purpose of the $\mbox{Fe}^3$ simulation engine is to enable a computationally efficient approach to address these questions.  
** Dynamics
In this section, we summarize the models  we will be using.
